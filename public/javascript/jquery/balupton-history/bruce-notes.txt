I modified this file replacing all occurences of +="/  with +=" so that slashes were not added to urls automatically.

also had to change m.clearAllIntervals=function(){ to m.clearAllIntervals=function(){return;  because on ie7, the interval was being clear before it even ran when prevent hashchange events from firing.
