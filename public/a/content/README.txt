------------

Installation
------------
Simply upload the files to the server and put it in a web-accessible directory.

You can change the colors of the background, alignment etc. by modifying the
loan.css file.

How it works
------------
The php script is divided into 3 parts. The first part is the form which reads
user's inputs. The 2nd part calculates and display the overall calculations.
The 3rd part shows the amortization details if the user checked the "Show 
Amortization" box.
