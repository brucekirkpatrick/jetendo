Anyway, this is a customer service follow up call to make sure you were able to find your way around the site and to answer any questions you might have. For example, many of our visitors have a little trouble navigating the MLS. \
\
Is there anything I can do to help? \
\
I also wanted to let you know of a new service offered by the MLS that a lot of people don't know about. We can actually set you up to receive emails of listings that fit your criteria as soon as they come on the market so that you are able to look before most people even know they are on the market and you don't have to visit the web site again and again. The cool part is you don't have to be tied into a Realtor to use it. Would you be interested in that?\
 \
(If \"No, not now\"...) \
Ok great. We want you to feel welcome to come back to the website to help you in your search, and we'd also love for you to call us with any questions you may have or for any assistance you might need.\
\
(If \"Yes\", set up listings by email.)\
Oh this (their dream home description) sounds nice! I'll bet it won't be any trouble at all for you to find a home like you're describing.\

"16","How Credit Scoring Works","How Credit Scoring Works","After we spoke earlier, I thought it might be helpful to send you a copy of an article I found that explains how the credit scoring process works. It was written by a company called Mortgage 101, and I've found it to be extremely helpful. Here's the article: \
Credit scoring is a statistical method that lenders use to quickly and objectively assess the credit risk of a loan applicant. The score is a number that rates the likelihood you will pay back a loan. Scores range from 350 (high-risk) to 950 (low- risk). There are a few types of credit scores; the most widely used are FICO scores, which were developed by Fair Isaac & Company, Inc., for each of the credit reporting agencies.\
\
Credit scores only consider the information contained in your credit profile. They do not consider your income, savings, down payment amount, or demographic factors like gender, race, nationality, or marital status. Past delinquencies, derogatory payment behavior, current debt level, length of credit history, types of credit, and number of inquiries are all considered in credit scores. Your score considers both positive and negative information in your credit report. Late payments will lower your score, but establishing or re-establishing a good track record of making payments on time will raise your score. Different portions of your credit file are given different weights. They are:\
\
35% - Previous credit performance (specific to your payment history)\
\
30% - Current level of indebtedness (current balance compared to high credit)\
\
15% - Time credit has been in use (opening date)\
\
15% - Types of credit available (installment loans, revolving and debit accounts)\
\
5% - Pursuit of new credit (number of inquiries)\
\
The most important factor for a good credit score is paying your bills on time. Even if the debt you owe is a small amount, it is crucial that you make payments on time. In addition, you may want to keep balances low on credit cards and other \"revolving credit\"; apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed; and pay off debt rather than moving it around. Also, don't close unused cards as a short-term strategy to raise your score. Owing the same amount but having fewer open accounts may lower your score.\
\
Recent changes minimize the negative effects that rate shopping can have on a mortgage applicant. If there is a consumer-originated inquiry within the past 365 days from mortgage or auto-related industries, these inquiries are ignored for scoring purposes for the first 30 calendar days; then multiple inquiries within the next 14 days are counted as one. Each inquiry will still appear on the credit report.\
\
Every score is accompanied by a maximum of four reason codes. Reason codes identify the most significant reason that you did not score higher. The reason codes can help a lender describe the reasons for higher-than-expected rates or loan denial. Scores are not part of the credit profile and are not covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\
\
Your credit report must contain at least one account which has been open for six months or greater, and at least one account that has been updated in the past six months, for you to get a credit score. This ensures that there is enough information in your report to generate an accurate score. If you do not meet the minimum criteria for getting a score, you may need to establish a credit history prior to applying for a mortgage. \

\
(Hotline Lead when you do not know the name of the person who called.) I wonder if you could help me?\
\
I got a message that someone from this number called our Hotline and I am supposed to do a customer service follow up call but I don't know the name of the person who called. You wouldn't happen to know who that was would you?\
\
(If you know the name of the person, then ask for them and start here.) I was paged to call you because you had accessed our 24-hour help line and we want to ask if you were able to get all the information you needed?\
\
Which house were you calling on?\
\
What is the most important feature that you look for in a house? Is it the number of bedrooms, the size, schools or something else?\
\
Let me ask you this - what tools do you find the most helpful in doing your house hunt? Is it the Internet, real estate magazines, newspaper or something else?\
\
The thing is, with thousands of homes for sale at any given time, it's almost impossible to sift through and find the really good deals. In fact most of the time, the best deals come on the market and sell long before they get printed in the newspapers and magazines.\
\
In fact, it generally takes over a month from the time a house first comes on the market before that house actually shows up in the home magazines. And, I'm willing to bet that you have found many houses you check on are already sold, haven't you? (Pause for response.)\
\
Our team is one of the top real estate teams in {agent's market}, and we try and let our buyer customers know of new listings BEFORE they get into the MLS, the magazines, and the Internet websites. Would you be interested in getting the inside track on any new listings that might fit your needs?\
