"1","Website Follow Up Script","Website Follow Up Script","This is {agent name} with {agent's company}. We noticed that you visited the website, and were searching homes in the area. Anyway, this is a customer service follow up call to make sure you were able to find your way around the site and to answer any questions you might have. For example, many of our visitors have a little trouble navigating the MLS. \
\
Is there anything I can do to help? \
\
I also wanted to let you know of a new service offered by the MLS that a lot of people don't know about. We can actually set you up to receive emails of listings that fit your criteria as soon as they come on the market so that you are able to look before most people even know they are on the market and you don't have to visit the web site again and again. The cool part is you don't have to be tied into a Realtor to use it. Would you be interested in that?\
 \
(If \"No, not now\"...) \
Ok great. We want you to feel welcome to come back to the website to help you in your search, and we'd also love for you to call us with any questions you may have or for any assistance you might need.\
\
(If \"Yes\", set up listings by email.)\
Oh this (their dream home description) sounds nice! I'll bet it won't be any trouble at all for you to find a home like you're describing.\
\
Thank you so much for speaking with me today. Feel free to call us here if you need anything at all, ok? Bye!","0","2","1","0"

We are currently gathering data, using the information you submitted, and will be trying to select comparable properties that have sold recently, as reported in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). \
\
We hope to finish the research within 24-48 hours and then contact you to review the results. After speaking briefly with you, we should be able to narrow down the valuation so as to be fairly accurate. In some cases it may be necessary for one of us to do a brief site inspection prior to finishing your valuation, but we will cross that bridge when and if we get to it.\

Don't worry! Sometimes the tax records aren't up to date, or information is improperly listed. I simply thought that it would be a good idea to let you know. \

By the way, if you aren't the owner but might be interested in buying this property, we are still willing to help you with the valuation. You may not be aware that, because we are buyer representatives, our services are free to our buyer clients. However, it's important to know whether we are trying to find you the most value possible (as a seller) or to protect you (as a buyer) from overpaying for the home. Either way, we are happy to help, but we need to understand your interest in the valuation.\

"16","How Credit Scoring Works","How Credit Scoring Works","After we spoke earlier, I thought it might be helpful to send you a copy of an article I found that explains how the credit scoring process works. It was written by a company called Mortgage 101, and I've found it to be extremely helpful. Here's the article: \
Credit scoring is a statistical method that lenders use to quickly and objectively assess the credit risk of a loan applicant. The score is a number that rates the likelihood you will pay back a loan. Scores range from 350 (high-risk) to 950 (low- risk). There are a few types of credit scores; the most widely used are FICO scores, which were developed by Fair Isaac & Company, Inc., for each of the credit reporting agencies.\
\
Credit scores only consider the information contained in your credit profile. They do not consider your income, savings, down payment amount, or demographic factors like gender, race, nationality, or marital status. Past delinquencies, derogatory payment behavior, current debt level, length of credit history, types of credit, and number of inquiries are all considered in credit scores. Your score considers both positive and negative information in your credit report. Late payments will lower your score, but establishing or re-establishing a good track record of making payments on time will raise your score. Different portions of your credit file are given different weights. They are:\
\
35% - Previous credit performance (specific to your payment history)\
\
30% - Current level of indebtedness (current balance compared to high credit)\
\
15% - Time credit has been in use (opening date)\
\
15% - Types of credit available (installment loans, revolving and debit accounts)\
\
5% - Pursuit of new credit (number of inquiries)\
\
The most important factor for a good credit score is paying your bills on time. Even if the debt you owe is a small amount, it is crucial that you make payments on time. In addition, you may want to keep balances low on credit cards and other \"revolving credit\"; apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed; and pay off debt rather than moving it around. Also, don't close unused cards as a short-term strategy to raise your score. Owing the same amount but having fewer open accounts may lower your score.\
\
Recent changes minimize the negative effects that rate shopping can have on a mortgage applicant. If there is a consumer-originated inquiry within the past 365 days from mortgage or auto-related industries, these inquiries are ignored for scoring purposes for the first 30 calendar days; then multiple inquiries within the next 14 days are counted as one. Each inquiry will still appear on the credit report.\
\
Every score is accompanied by a maximum of four reason codes. Reason codes identify the most significant reason that you did not score higher. The reason codes can help a lender describe the reasons for higher-than-expected rates or loan denial. Scores are not part of the credit profile and are not covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\
\
Your credit report must contain at least one account which has been open for six months or greater, and at least one account that has been updated in the past six months, for you to get a credit score. This ensures that there is enough information in your report to generate an accurate score. If you do not meet the minimum criteria for getting a score, you may need to establish a credit history prior to applying for a mortgage. \

"17","Listings Follow-up","Listings Follow-up","I wanted to drop you this quick note to confirm that you have received the email home listings that I have been sending you. If you have been unable to view them, let me know and I will be happy to resend the information by email or fax, or even to send you a printed copy if need be.\
\
After you've had a chance to look at these listings, I would appreciate your feedback. It is fairly common for my customers to begin receiving listings and realize that the search criteria is not quite right. I am happy to adjust the search so we can help you find exactly what you are looking for. Don't be embarrassed or hesitant to let me change your search—it is part of my service to you.\
\
By the way, when you find a home you would like to see in person, I am happy to arrange for a private viewing. Just give me a call or email me and I will set it up. In the mean time I will continue to send you more listings as they become available.\
